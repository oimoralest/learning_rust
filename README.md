# Learning Rust

## Description

This is a collection of Rust code examples that I've written while learning Rust.

I have followed the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) tutorials.

## Installing Rust

To install Rust, follow the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
